# PopUpView
Simple script that if saved in a bookmark, when opened, creates a new window with minimal borders, like a pop-up embedded view of the current page.

## How do I use it?
Super simple and straightforward.

- right click on the bookmark bar, select "add new bookmark".
- as the URL of the bookmark copy the script inside of the "PopItUp.js" file.
- done

Now if you want to see a webpage in a pop-up style view, or a youtube video embedded into a floating window, you can!
